Looping back to previous nodes? Go ahead.
Looping back to ourselves? Definitely!

Now with that said, nodes without outgoing edges SHOULD be terminal nodes.
And everything is connected.  And outgoing nodes have deterministic transitions.

{-
This function is to get the "forward" transitions of a word that is
being added.  It is used, initially, to add the correct cloned/queued
states to a DFA in Phase 1 of union/intersection.  Then, in Phase 3,
it is used to guide the remove-unreachable algorithm to the correct
states that might need to be removed.

However, the word "forward" is misleading.  In fact, the point is that
we shouldn't have _BACKWARD_ transitions (or recursive ones), because
then our algorithms might get trapped in a loop.

Consider

t ----------> e -> s
 \            ↑
  `-> k -> p -'

t -> k -> p -> e is a fair path forward.  So is t -> e.  I actually
should be looking at both of them, in terms of forward routes.  And
this is why I cannot return a `List Char` from this function, because
I must consider multiple routes.  Instead, I need to return and use
a tree structure.

  -- This should work because
  -- 1. We clone all nodes to a new start.  We therefore have an
  --    old-start and a new-start that are distinct.  We should always
  --    be able to remove the old-start (it has 0 incoming edges).
  -- 2. We redirected all outgoing edges of the existing nodes along the
  --    w-path, with the EXCEPTION of the w-path edges themselves.  So,
  --    if there are any incoming edges that come to the old w-path nodes,
  --    then they must be coming from:
  --    (a) the old w-path nodes.
  --    (b) non-w-path nodes.
  -- 3. After a node is removed, we can remove the next node (if it has 0
  --    incoming edges), and so on.  We stop whenever we have at least 1
  --    incoming edge.  This is according to Carrasco & Forcada's algorithm.
  --    However, if w-path nodes are recursive, then this fails, because each
  --    will have incoming edges from the other, and we can't clean them up.
  -- 4. So, instead, we will go for a slightly different algorithm.
  --    Step 1: collect all the nodes along the old w-path.  Place them in a
  --            set. 
  --    Step 2: partition the nodes into those which have an external incoming
  --            edge ("R"), and those which do not ("S").
  --    Step 3: moving in w-path order, examine the nodes of S.  If a node has
  --            an incoming node in R, add it to R and remove it from S.
  --            In other words, this is a partition refinement.
  --    Step 4: remove all the nodes in the S set.
  --    This should work because we are no longer relying on each node to be
  --    0-incoming BECAUSE of node-removal.  Instead, we are relying on each
  --    node to be 0-incoming after checking for external references directly.
